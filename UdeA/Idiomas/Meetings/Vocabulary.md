Hello, my name is CosmoCristian and I'm a space traveler. I go through the stars looking for other interesting planets and solar system. Space is a lonely place, there's nobody to talk with, or planets I can live in.
I only found one planet with plants and other microscopic life, but they can't speak with me. 
Let me tell you a story. In 30th century, I went out from earth. There are no water and appropiate climate conditions for life, after 3 industrial revolutions and 4 nuclear wars, humans destroyed our mother-planet. We needed to looking for others planets that they could be our next home. We go throug our solar system and visited every single planet in our galaxy, but we didn't find anything. I didn't know that we were so alone in our galaxy, that was frustrating and scary. 
The we visited Andromeda, and make some stops in different planets to get some resources, like minerals, oxygen, and other stuff. That galaxy was amazing for us, we saw many different planets and other possibilities were presented to us. We were excited by the new discoveries we were doing. We found so many planets in the habitable-area of their stars and some of them with different spectra that indicated to us that, possible there is life. We visited some of them and found A-189, a white planet, fulled of snow. That is an indicator of water and possibly of life. 
We studied a underground sea that it's in the planet and we found the most hot points on water looking for a signal of life, and better for intelligent life. But we didn't see anything. We only see some aquatic plants and take some samples of water to study and looking for life. 
Eureka, we found some microscopic life carbon-based. There are conditions to bacterian and animal life. We were found a second home.

3 years later, we still in A-189. But let me tell you a secret. It's amazing, but we have studied this planet for 2000 years and we have not discovery nothing, it's really boring. I still studying planets to see if we can find some friends, and start a new life, watching interesting things. We've not explored more than 0.1% of visible space, but this, is only the beginning.
