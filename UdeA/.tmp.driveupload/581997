Ads connect with our mind in a 
Deeper level and invite to 
Consumers to 
Run over to shop with the most
Effectively tactics that can put 
A sense of needing in people, that is 
They look for with their strategies. 
I think that we need to put our feelings in a 
Vault and think about what actually need. Not what actually we want. 
Early, we can imagine a better world. 
.
AdCreative.ai can help me with that when 
I uninstall the application and start to be free.

Perhaps you feel a 
Sense of needing before to buy something but 
You don't actually need it. It is because you can't 
Choose freely what purchases you will make. 
However, we have reasoning and we need to put
Out of our minds all the strategies and
Lies that companies teel us. Go
Out to the street and purchase only what you need. If you want a 
Green bag, or a red bag, it doesn't actually care. 
You need a fucking bag, awake, please.
